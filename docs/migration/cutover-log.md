# Cutover log

One section per module and gate (roadmap "Module status lifecycle"). Record
evidence, not intent: commands, counts, links, numbers.

## projects (wave 1, pilot)

### G0 entry: met 2026-10-29

- Routes: 4 in `docs/migration/routes.json` (`projectsList`, `projectsCreate`,
  `projectsPatch`, `projectsDelete`). All are in the spec with `x-lv-module: projects`
  (`LuminaVaultServer` `scripts/tag-spec.py --check` → all operations marked).
- Prefix: `/v1/projects`, disjoint from every other module (`internal/manifest`
  `TestEveryRouteHasExactlyOneOwner`).
- Coupling: none. Projects publishes and subscribes to no in-process channel
  (`coupling.md`).
- Jobs: none (`jobs.md`).
- Route middleware: only `jwtAuthenticator`. No rate limit, tier or Hermes
  middleware on the group (`App+build.swift`, `projectsGroup`).
- Swift tests: `Tests/AppTests/Skills/ProjectModelTests.swift` (2 tests).

### G1 parity: met 2026-10-29 (local; CI evidence pending)

- Parity: `scripts/parity-up.sh` against `lv-swift:fdbed9b0`, then
  `parity compare` gives **4 scenarios, 0 differences** (base/health, projects
  crud, errors, isolation). 42 steps cover every route with success and error
  cases: no token, bad token, malformed, empty, array, missing, null and
  wrong-type bodies, whitespace names, random and malformed ids, cross-tenant
  patch and delete. 11 of those steps take DB snapshots of `projects`.
- Self-test (Swift vs Swift): **0 differences**, so the scenarios are deterministic.
- Go tests: `internal/modules/projects` (9 tests on Postgres + baseline + seed)
  port both Swift `ProjectModelTests` assertions (DTO round trip,
  tenant scoping). `TestResponsesConformToSpec` validates the bodies against
  `api/openapi.yaml`.
- `golangci-lint run`: 0 issues. `govulncheck`: no reachable vulnerabilities.
- Pending: the same results from the `parity` CI job. It needs the
  `luminavaultserver` GHCR package to grant Lumina-Vault-Server-Go read access
  (decisions.md D-parity-ci).

### G2 staging deploy: not started

Blocked on human steps:
1. Merge LuminaVaultInfra #486 (chart) and #487 (netpol).
2. Merge this repo's branch to `main`, which publishes the first image. `INFRA_REPO_TOKEN` must be set.
3. Put that SHA into #488 and merge it.
4. Provide a staging session token for `make parity-smoke MODULE=projects`.
